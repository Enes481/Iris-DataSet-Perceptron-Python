Description:
This repository contains a Python implementation of a single-layer perceptron. The perceptron is trained on the Iris dataset to classify flower types based on their features.

The project includes:

  A custom perceptron implementation using Python.
  Training and testing of the perceptron on the Iris dataset.
  Visualization of the results and evaluation metrics.
  
This work was developed as an assignment, demonstrating the basics of neural network training and classification using a single perceptron.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and adapt the code for learning or further development.
